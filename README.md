# Near-Field-Communication-NFC-For-Unity-Android
Simple NFC Android app created with Unity. Feel free to use this project to create your own Unity Android app which can read out NFC tags. 


The project was originally developed by ChristopheGeske using Unity 2017.3.1f1 and updated to Unity 2021.3.5f1 by liswifi. Updated project has been tested using a Galaxy S10 running Android 12.


**How to use:**
1. Change the platform to Android in build settings
2. Create or add a keystore in *Player Settings > Publishing Settings > Keystore Manager*
3. Input keystore and project key password in *Publishing Settings*
4. The project will now build

You can also download and install either .apk file which are small demo apps for the original and new version of the project, demonstrating its functionality.  

This app is not currently able to write informations onto NFC tags.

On the Samsung Galaxy S10 the distance to the NFC tag needs to be less than 4 cm for reading. You can find NFC tags on books, your travel passport, VISA cards or your mensa card. You can read out all these tags with the NFC module in your phone.

Be sure to enable NFC in the phone settings.

This project was inspired by this forum discussion. Check it out to learn more about the code and how to scan multiple tags.
